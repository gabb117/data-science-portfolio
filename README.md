📊 Analysis Steps

Data Loading & Cleaning
Check for missing values.
Inspect data types and descriptive statistics.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize distributions of Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
Scatterplots to explore relationships between income and spending.
Group analysis by gender or age brackets.
Optional: Clustering (KMeans)
Segment customers based on Annual Income and Spending Score.
Visualize clusters and centroids to identify customer groups.
Insights & Conclusions
Identify trends and patterns in spending behavior.
Highlight customer segments that may be targeted for marketing strategies.
📈 Key Insights (example)

Customers with higher annual income tend to spend more, but some moderate-income customers also have high spending scores.
Younger customers may have a different spending pattern compared to older ones.
Optional clustering can reveal distinct customer segments for targeted marketing.
